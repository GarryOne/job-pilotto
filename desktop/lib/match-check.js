// CV match: one CV against one job posting, the way a recruiter's search and a hiring system's match grade meet them.
// Which terms the posting asks for does the CV state (found), only suggest (implied) or never mention (missing); which requirements of the posting
// a screening question could turn into a yes/no (work permit, place and office days, language, licence, clearance), and whether the CV and the Profile support
// them. A grade is a sort order that recruiters override, not a verdict (docs/research/ats-reddit-2026-10.md). Facts only: a missing term is "add it only if
// it is true". On request (a few cents); the last answer for a job is kept in cv/match/<code>.json, for the CV it was made with.

grade: A = the CV states most of what the posting asks for, B = most, with gaps, C = partly, D = little. It is a sort order, not a verdict. summary: one sentence.
musts: at most 10 skills, tools, methods or titles the posting asks for, most important first. status: found = the CV states it plainly (evidence = a short phrase from the
CV), implied = the CV's work suggests it without saying it (evidence = that work, or ""), missing = the CV never mentions it (evidence = "").
knockouts: at most 8 requirements in the posting that an application form could turn into a yes/no question: work authorisation or visa, place and office days,
language, security clearance, a licence or certification, years of experience, notice or start date. status: ok = the CV or the Profile supports it, check = neither says,
so the person must confirm it, conflict = the CV or the Profile contradicts it. note: one short sentence. Never claim an employer will reject: say "can" or "may".
advice: at most 4 short, concrete points. Hard rules: use only what the CV, the Profile and the posting say. Never suggest adding a tool, number or experience the CV does
not state; for a missing term say "add it only if it is true". Keep every sentence short and plain.`;
