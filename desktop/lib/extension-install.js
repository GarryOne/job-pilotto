// Is the Job Pilotto extension loaded in a Chromium browser on this computer — and is it awake?
//
// The extension reports in every 30 s (extension/background.js) and that report is the only proof it is really
// running: it is what lets the app fill a form right now. But "no report" is not "not installed" — the browser may
// be closed, or the extension may simply be between alarms. The browser itself recorded the answer in its profile,
// so read that: a file read tells installed / turned off / open Chrome apart at once, instead of the app showing
// "Checking…" for a minute and then guessing (1 Oct 2026).
//
// The Mac and the PC keep those profiles, and their browsers, in different places; both are read here.
