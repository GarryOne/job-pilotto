// The shared pool end to end (7 Oct 2026): what an install sends to the central scout and what it does with the central list, through the real engine
// code against a local stand-in of the website (tools/pool_e2e.py): Find new employers sends each find and dead end at once, Search for jobs every feed
// and board it read, only what changed, nothing when switched off, never the search's own words; a photographer's crawl leaves out software firms and
// feeds where no photographer found a job; employers and job sources ranked for people like them; the list checked hourly by its publish time.
// No app window, no Notion, no AI: about ten seconds. Each check is its own step.
