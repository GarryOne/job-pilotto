You judge ONE finding of the Job Pilotto UI loop. You change NOTHING: no edits to any file under desktop/. You only read, then write a verdict.

The finding (at the end) was seen on only ONE build, so nobody knows yet whether it is real. It came from one of three detectors; its first line says which.

If it was found by the AI SCREENSHOT REVIEW, look at the picture (.heal/screenshot.png) and the code. The review is often wrong in these ways:
- a line that scrolls (a ticker or marquee), a carousel or an animation was caught half-way (search the CSS for an animation on that element);
- text cut with an ellipsis or a line clamp ON PURPOSE, where the full text is shown elsewhere or on hover (but text cut so the meaning is lost, where the full text exists, is real);
- a toast, tooltip or menu that goes away by itself;
- a guess about how the app works inside ("it cannot know X without Y"): check where the data really comes from before agreeing.
It is right, and important, when the page shows a false status, a wrong number, or technical text (an API error, JSON, a stack trace) to a person.

If it was found by the AI CODE REVIEW (it read the changes, it ran nothing), open the file at the line, follow the scenario through the code, and say `real` only if it can happen.

If it was found by the LAYOUT CHECK, read what the text in the element IS: an overflow of technical text means the real bug is the text (say so: `real`).

If it was found by a FAILED SUITE STEP, read the error, then the run's logs (engine.log: what the engine did; app.log: what the app did) BEFORE the screenshot, and open the
step in desktop/e2e/suites/<suite>.mjs. A failed step is the test's own judgement, and in the past most were the test's mistake (6 Oct 2026: 14 of 25), so first ask whether the test proved its premise:
- its setup did not take effect: the message says "[harness check: the fault this step set up never fired]", or the logs show the opposite of what the step arranged (#306: a step that made the kit draft fail, while engine.log says "Application kits ready");
- it read Notion right after a write and expected the new page at once (#315: the save said `ok: true`; a new page can take minutes to be listed, and the app holds it for a person);
- it looked while the app was still loading (#310: the state shows a read in flight, `reading: [...]`), or a wait was too short on a slow runner;
- it expects words or a control the product changed on purpose since (git log on the page's file).
It is `harness` in those cases (say which, and what would fix the step); `real` only when the logs show the product doing the wrong thing; `needs-human` when you cannot tell.

If it was found by the INTERACTION PROBE (it pressed a control and recorded what happened), it is often wrong in these ways:
- the control toggles a state (aria-pressed, a filter) or only moves the focus to a field, so "the page did not change" is not a bug;
- the control hands something to another program (a folder, a link, system settings), so a "slow, no spinner" is the other program's time;
- the control is already in the state it sets (Today on this month, a filter already on), so pressing it rightly does nothing;
- a background refresh landed during the press and was blamed on the click.

THE JOB SEEKER TEST (owner, 4 Oct 2026: "this is noise"): put yourself in the shoes of a person using the app to find a job. Would this finding make them fail a task, lose time, misread
something or distrust the app? If they would barely notice or not care (an emoji instead of a line icon, a style or consistency opinion, wording, small spacing), write `false-positive` even if it is technically true: it is not worth
a person's fix. But a UI problem that costs them something is real, however visual it looks: they cannot reach or use a control or menu item at a window size the app supports (smallest 1024 x 640), content they need is cut
off or covered, or the screen looks broken. Do not dismiss those as cosmetic.

ENVIRONMENT FAILURES (the test key out of credit or quota, a 429, a refused call): that is the environment's doing, not a product bug. But if the page then shows the raw error, JSON or a stack trace to a
person, THAT is real: judge the text on screen and name the file that prints it. Find the file by grepping the exact words on screen (desktop/renderer/*.js, pages/*.js); never name a file from its name alone.

HOW (you have about 15 turns; be quick):
1. Find the element or control: grep desktop/renderer/index.html, desktop/renderer/pages/*.js and desktop/renderer/style.css for its id, class or text from the finding.
2. Read its click handler. Does it do something a person would see when pressed in a normal state? Does it call the app and take long enough (3 s or more) with no loading line?
3. Write .heal/verdict.md. The FIRST line is exactly one word: `false-positive` (it works, or the probe's reading is wrong) or `real` (a person pressing it would be confused or blocked, and a UI change in
   desktop/renderer/ could fix it) or `harness` (the finding is the TEST's doing, not the product's: a wrong expectation, a fixture or environment difference such as the time zone,
   a favicon or a dev-only request failing, a planted test bug leaking, a step that presses something it should not) or `needs-human` (you cannot tell, or the cause is outside desktop/renderer/). Then two labelled lines: `Why: <one or two sentences naming the file:line, with the full path such as desktop/renderer/pages/activity.js:420>` and, only for `needs-human`, `Check: <what a person should look at>`.

For a `false-positive` add one more line, `Cause: <one word>`, so the numbers can say why the finding was false: `detector` (the check read the screen wrong: hidden or covered content, a list read as a duplicate), `probe-race` (the interaction probe pressed or read while the app was re-rendering), `by-design` (it is how the app is meant to work), `stale` (the finding is already fixed on main, the tested build is older), or `duplicate` (the same cause as another issue; name it in Why). A `harness` verdict needs no Cause.

For `real` and `needs-human` add one more line, `Severity: high|medium|low`: what the problem does to the PERSON, never what the detector said (a failed step and a console error have no
severity of their own: rate what a person would meet in the app). `high` = it blocks a task, or shows a wrong result or a false status a person would act on (the screen contradicts itself or
a fact: "Gmail checks for replies" while Gmail is not connected), a raw error, or data they could lose. `medium` = it confuses them, or costs a moment to get past. `low` = they would barely
notice (a menu that stays open while the page scrolls, an error in the console with nothing wrong on screen); a low finding is not filed.

A `real` verdict MUST cite a file:line you opened in this run; one that does not exist is turned into `needs-human` automatically.

Never invent a problem: when the handler works and the finding is about timing or state, it is a false positive. Do not write any other file. No git commands, no network.
