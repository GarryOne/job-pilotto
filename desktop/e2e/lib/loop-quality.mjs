// never a made-up value. Pure: selfheal-stats.mjs gathers the inputs.
//   escape     bugs the Finder did NOT catch (the Notion Bug Tracker's "Caught by e2e": No - gap) of all bugs it could judge, last 30 days
//   guard      of the bugs it missed, how many got a guard (a test, a check, a plant) and not only an idea: whether a miss is closed, not just logged
//   judge      the verdict pass's exam: planted findings with known answers (lib/judge-exam.mjs), scored every week with no one ticking anything
//   mutation   the weekly mutation test's catch rate (mutation.yml)
//   verdicts   the verdict pass's accuracy from the owner's ticks in the weekly audits (verdict-audit issues)
//   regression fixed defects that came back (label `regression`) per defect closed by a fix
//   flake      failed-step issues marked `flaky` (passed on the same commit) of all failed-step issues
