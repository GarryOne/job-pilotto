Judge only the TEXT against the POSTING and the CANDIDATE:
- grounded: every claim in the text can be found in the posting or the candidate's profile.
- contradicts_posting: the text says something the posting says the opposite of (a place, a seniority, a language rule, a work mode, a salary).
- invents_facts: the text states a fact (a figure, technology, requirement, benefit, employer detail) that is in neither the posting nor the profile. Reasonable judgement ("a strong match") is not a fact, and neither is correct common knowledge (rough geography, a currency conversion, simple arithmetic on the posting's own figures, what a role title usually means). A caveat that says something is not stated, unknown or unspecified ("visa sponsorship unspecified", "no salary stated") is not an invented fact: listing unknowns is wanted. A claim that is WRONG by common knowledge or arithmetic (a 2-hour trip called a short commute, a wrong percentage) is an invented fact.
- useful: a person deciding whether to apply learns something specific from it (not just "good fit").
