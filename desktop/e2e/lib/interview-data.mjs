[00:00:41] Recruiter: How do you handle an incident where the root cause is unclear?
[00:00:49] You: I start with the user impact, stabilise first by rolling back the last change, then work the timeline from metrics and traces. I keep a written log and run a blameless review within the week.
[00:01:20] Recruiter: What is your experience with Terraform at scale?
[00:01:27] You: Six years. I maintain about two hundred modules, with plan checks in CI and a policy gate, but I have not run a multi cloud estate.
[00:02:02] Recruiter: Good. The next step is a technical interview with the platform lead, probably next week. Salary range is one hundred forty to one hundred sixty thousand francs.`;
