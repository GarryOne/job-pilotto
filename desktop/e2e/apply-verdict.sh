#   JUDGE="triage session (Claude Code, with the owner)" names who judged in the comment's footer; the default is the CI verdict pass. Runs from the repo root (evidence is checked there).
# The verdict file: first line the word (real | false-positive | harness | needs-human | fixed), then "Why: …", "Cause: …" (a false positive's), "Severity: high|medium|low",
# evidence as file:line (desktop/e2e/lib/verdict-comment.mjs parses it). What it does: the comment (banner, why, evidence, next step); the judge's severity on a real or parked
# finding (severity.mjs); the labels the stats read (confirmed, wontfix-auto, harness, needs-human, resolution:<why>, lib/resolution.mjs); closing a false positive, a harness
# finding or a fixed one. Guarded by desktop/e2e/test/apply-verdict.test.mjs.
