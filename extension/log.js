// leave no trace anywhere — which is why 1 Oct 2026's wrong "Applied" could not be explained. Every decision is kept
// in a small ring buffer in chrome.storage.local and pushed to the app, whose log holds it (`grep extension
// logs/app.log`); entries the push could not deliver stay unsent and go with the next one, so a crashed worker's
// last decisions still arrive. Ids, hosts, reasons and counts only — never a form answer or a page's text.
