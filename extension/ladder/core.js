// The ladder's signals and the one rule that says which rung to ask next (spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-10-ai-ladder.md). Pure: no chrome API, no AI, no storage, so the
// extension and the app (desktop/shared/ladder-core.js, copied by scripts/stage.mjs) decide the same way. Every rung of the applying flow answers with one fixed SIGNAL; a rung that is
// not confident hands the page to the next rung that is on and not capped, and the top is the person. The caps and the switches are the caller's (desktop/lib/ladder.js).
// Invariants (flow core: read before editing; changing one is the owner's call, said in the commit; each names the test that guards it):
//  1. Rungs and signals are fixed lists; the log line is exactly `ladder: rung N signal S` (job-pilotto-b8's admin parser reads it) and is empty for a confident rung (desktop/test/ladder-core.test.js).
//  2. Only a signal that is not confident climbs; a rung that is off or capped is skipped, never asked (desktop/test/ladder-core.test.js).
//  3. The router never starts Claude's takeover (rung 5): after the picture comes the person, who is offered it (desktop/test/ladder-core.test.js).
//  4. An unknown rung or signal is never guessed: it goes to the person (desktop/test/ladder-core.test.js).
