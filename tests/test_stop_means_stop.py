"""A run stopped by the app (SIGTERM: Stop, quitting the app) ends within seconds, even with checks in flight, and keeps what it finished.

7 Oct 2026: a Find new employers run went on for minutes after the app quit (its 6 worker threads were waited for), held the run lock so the
restarted run waited for it, and lost every employer it had checked (they were saved only at the end of the batch)."""
