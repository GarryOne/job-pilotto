# Knowledge between sessions: every lesson in its strongest form

Owner, 11 Oct 2026 ("yes, let's follow this method, way of working"). Linked from CLAUDE.md.

**Every lesson lands in the strongest form that can hold it:**

| # | The lesson is… | It lands as… |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | a trap or a past bug | a test, fixture or recorded page that fails. A live bug becomes a failing test/scenario/recorded page BEFORE its fix (it must fail on the old build). |
| 2 | a hard rule | a gate or hook + one CLAUDE.md line |
| 3 | how to do a kind of task | a skill step (+ its `lessons.md`) |
| 4 | the owner's preferences and decisions | memory (auto-loaded) and the Decision Log (the why, read on demand) |
| 5 | what is in flight | spec checklists (`/report-progress`), claims (`tools/claim-shape.mjs`), the `/admin/applying` Fixed tab, the open-work memory |
| 6 | what the code does | the code, its header comment, `node desktop/scripts/codemap.mjs <words>` |

**A note alone is the weakest form.** The Run Log and the Session Handoff rotted: 2 of 56 sessions in a week read the Handoff (62 KB, a week stale).
Both were retired on 11 Oct 2026 ([why.md](why.md#change-loop)).

**Before saying done:** what did this task teach, and what is the strongest form that can hold it?

**Kept alive by:** each skill's self-improve step, a post-mortem when a task takes much longer than it should, and the weekly self-review
workflow (`.github/workflows/weekly-self-review.yml`).
