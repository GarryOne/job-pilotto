// The GitHub-side watchdog of the Worker's on-time starts (6 Oct 2026). The owner looks at GitHub only; the Worker's own warnings live on Cloudflare (its cron history)
// and Telegram, and none of them can speak when the Worker itself is broken: on 5-6 Oct a freshly created Worker had no secrets, every start was refused for a day, and
// nothing on GitHub said so. schedule-watchdog.yml runs this on GitHub's own (late, but eventual) schedule: it lists the starts the Worker should have made, from the
// same crons and rules it runs (scheduler.js), finds each one's run, and keeps one issue open while any is missing. Pure: the CLI is scripts/watchdog.mjs.
