// Does the form-filling loop learn? Bugs are planted in the reader (extension/page/fill.js), one at a time, on a corpus of real
// layouts (Greenhouse, Ashby). For each plant, the loop must on its own: notice the question it no longer reads (coverage), send
// it in a fill-failure report with its HTML (desktop/lib/reports.js -> worker/src/report.js), queue it for triage at once, and
// turn it into a replay fixture (tools/fill-fixture.mjs) that is RED while the bug is there and GREEN once it is gone: the fix is
// proven. Recall = plants caught / plants planted, printed as a scorecard; anything below 100% fails.
