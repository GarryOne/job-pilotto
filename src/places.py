"""Place words that stand for many places, worked out by AI instead of a list. "Germany" must find a job posted as "Leipzig", "Asia" one in "Singapore": a posting's
location is usually a city, rarely the country or the region. Nobody keeps a list of every city of every country, so a small model is asked once per word, the answer
is checked here and kept on this computer (data/places.json), and every later crawl reads the file: no AI call, no cost. (src/regions.py keeps Switzerland's fixed
table: deterministic, tested, works offline.)

What the model says is data, never a pattern: each name must be plain letters, spaces, hyphens, dots or apostrophes (otherwise it is dropped), it is escaped and matched
as a whole word, and a wrong or missing city costs one false or missed match, nothing else. A word the model calls a city is left as the user wrote it.
No CV and no personal data is sent: the place words of the search, nothing more.

(the local name and the English name when they differ, e.g. "München" and "Munich"), plus the states, provinces or countries inside it when it is a region or a country with \\
states. Short forms postings use, such as "UK", "USA", "NYC", count too. Only real places: never invent one, and leave out a name that is also a common word.
For a city or other: names = [] (up to three other spellings of the city that postings really use, if any).
