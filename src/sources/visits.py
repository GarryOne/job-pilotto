with no open API (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, levels.fyi). The app lists them; you open one in your own Chrome, as yourself, and the
extension's "Read the jobs on this page" sends the page you see to the app. Nothing here browses, clicks, logs in or gets past a check:
the page arrives only because a person opened it and pressed the button.

filters, scores and tracks them like any other feed. A page read more than STALE_DAYS ago is offered again."""
