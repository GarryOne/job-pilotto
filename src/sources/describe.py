"""Descriptions for jobs that arrived without one.

Some boards list postings without their text (SmartRecruiters), and a job board's detail page can fail on the day a
job is found (jobs.ch). Without a description a job never gets stage 1 facts or a fit score, and nothing tried
again: it sat in the list with "–". Each run fetches the missing ones from the posting itself, newest first, a few
at a time (the importer keeps them: it only ever writes a real description over an empty one).
