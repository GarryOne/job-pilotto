"""The engine's one way to let AI decide what content means, in any language, instead of keyword lists (owner, 8 Oct 2026: "Let the AI
interpret/decide rather than relying on hard-coded keywords ... scalable to thousands of websites, forms, CVs"; CLAUDE.md "Meaning comes
from AI, never from keyword lists").

Lookup order: this computer's decisions -> the meanings pack (src/ai/meanings_pack.py: the old keyword lists as seed, plus what the site
learned) -> the model. decide(topic, items, answers, instructions): each item (key -> short text) gets exactly one of the fixed `answers`, which is all the code
ever reads. A small model answers in batches; every answer is kept per (topic, key) in jobs.sqlite (`decisions`), so an item is asked once.
It returns None when no AI is available or a call fails: the caller then uses its rule (a safety net, never the decider when AI runs).
The text sent is untrusted page/email text, and the model is told so; nothing it writes is used except the chosen answer.
Tests: tests/test_decide.py."""
