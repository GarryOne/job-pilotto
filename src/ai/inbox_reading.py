SYSTEM = """The owner of Job Pilotto pastes a message or a screenshot (LinkedIn, Gmail, WhatsApp, a job site) about their \
job search. Read it (for a screenshot, read the text in the image) and say:
- "Feedback received" = the employer's specific assessment during or after a hiring process. A rejection
  containing specific feedback stays "Rejected" with feedback filled. feedback is a verbatim quote of the
  employer's reasons or assessment; empty for generic rejections. Never turn the candidate's own request,
  quoted old messages, or a model guess into employer feedback.
- kind: "Recruiter outreach" = a recruiter or hiring person pitches a role; "Applied" = proof the owner applied (an \
application page or a copy of it); "Confirmation received" = automatic acknowledgement; "Reply received" = a person \
answered without a fixed time (booking link, test, questions, "let's chat"); "Interview scheduled" = a call booked at a \
stated time; "Rejected"; "Offer"; "Not job-related" = anything else, including people selling services to the \
owner (web design, marketing, outsourcing), networking or event invitations, and automated job alerts.
- match: the index of the job in the list below that the item is about (same company, or same agency/recruiter, and \
same role), or -1. The list includes pitches already logged: the same recruiter pitching the same role again (or the \
same message pasted twice) is that job. When the company has several roles and the item doesn't say which, answer -1.
- The other fields: only what the item states, never guesses. owner_agreed: the owner said yes / agreed to talk.
- seen: for each of channel, year, first contact, interview and company, whether the item shows it or you inferred it.
  seen.agreement: "shown" when the owner's own reply says yes / agrees to a call / books one (then owner_agreed is true); "declined" when the owner said no or not interested; "none" when the owner hasn't replied; "unclear" when the owner replied but it isn't clear whether they agreed to talk (e.g. only asked a question). Otherwise owner_agreed is false.
  Dates without a visible year: fill the ISO fields with your best reading but set seen.year "missing".
- booking_link: a link the other person sent for the owner to book a call or pick a time, exactly as written; "" if none.
- last_message: the last visible message of the conversation (for an email: that email): who wrote it (the owner = \
"you"), its day and time exactly as written (a chat's day divider such as "MONDAY" or "TODAY" above it, plus its time), \
and its first words.
The owner's own messages may be in the screenshot; the other person is the recruiter or employer."""
