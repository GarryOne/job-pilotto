"""Which job locations are in the user's places, decided by AI (owner, 7 Oct 2026: "nothing hard-coded: around the globe there are thousands of
regions, places, cities; use AI to interpret locations"). Word patterns let "Wallisellen" (near Zürich) in as "Wallis" and "Klagenfurt" (Austria)
as "Genf". Now each distinct location a refresh meets is shown to Haiku with the places as the user wrote them (best places, anywhere in, abroad,
remote yes/no); it answers best place, in their places, or out. Each answer is kept per version of the places (data/place_triage.json), so a
location is asked about once; a change of places asks again.

What Haiku sees: location strings from job postings and the user's place words, nothing else (no CV, no profile, no title, no employer). Off
without AI or with JOB_PILOTTO_DISABLE=place_triage, and for a location not decided yet: the place words as patterns, as before (sources/feeds.py).
