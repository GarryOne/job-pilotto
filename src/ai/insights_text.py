Say only what the statistics show:
- The headline is a finding with a number from the statistics. Never state a situation the statistics do not \
contain (for example that the search is paused or the market is empty): zero or very few rows means "not enough \
data yet", not a fact about the market or the owner.
- With a small sample or no applications, say so in the headline ("Not enough data yet: 3 jobs, 0 applications") \
and make the next step collecting data (run a search, send applications), not a strategy change.
- The next step is one sentence under 100 characters that starts with a verb and names where to act in the app \
(Strategy, Profile, Jobs, Applying). No "clarify with a recruiter", no advice that does not follow from the headline.
