"""The AI engine every AI step calls through: one factory, `client()`, over the engines in src/ai/providers/.

JOB_PILOTTO_AI_ENGINE picks it, as the user chose it (Settings → AI in the app):
  api    (default; GitHub / Always on, the Telegram worker, the free-credit relay)  the Anthropic SDK, their key (providers/anthropic_api.py)
  cli    (the app, on the user's Mac)                                           their own Claude Code, Claude plan (providers/claude_code.py)
  openai (the app or Always on)                                                  OpenAI's Responses API, their key (providers/openai_api.py)
  codex  (the app, on the user's Mac)                                           their own Codex CLI, ChatGPT plan (providers/codex_cli.py)
Nothing is chosen for the user: no automatic switch. JOB_PILOTTO_AI_FALLBACK=api|openai (the user's own tick, "If my plan's limit is hit,
use my API key") lets a plan engine hand the rest of a run to the API key of the SAME family; never Claude to OpenAI or back.

Every engine is an adapter behind one contract (providers/contract.py): `client().messages.create(**the SDK's arguments)` returns an
object shaped like the Anthropic SDK's response (`.content[0].type/.text`, `.usage`, `.stop_reason`, `.model`), so the AI modules work
unchanged. A plan's usage carries `billing = 'subscription'`: cost.py counts its tokens at $0, and the budget guard never sees it as API dollars.
This file keeps the names the modules and tests import; the engines' own code lives in providers/.
