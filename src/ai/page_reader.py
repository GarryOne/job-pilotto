"""Claude reads a careers page that has no machine-readable jobs and lists the jobs on it.

Most small employers publish their jobs as plain page text and links, not as job data. Rules can find the links (careers.job_links) but
cannot tell a job title from a menu entry, or a location from a sentence. A small model can. It is only asked when the rules found nothing
useful and the page names a role you look for, and the answer is kept by the page's text (a hash): a page is read again only when its
text changes, so a feed that is crawled every four hours costs one small call when the page changes, not six a day.
The page is untrusted text. The answer has a fixed shape (title, place, link); links must lead to the employer's own site, and
nothing the model writes is ever used as an instruction or shown as anything but a job title and a place.
