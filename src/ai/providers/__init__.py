"""The AI engines a user can choose, each an adapter behind one contract (contract.py), and how each is built from the environment.

JOB_PILOTTO_AI_ENGINE names the engine, as the user chose it in the app (Settings → AI). Nothing is chosen for the user and nothing switches
by itself: an engine's `fallback` (another engine of the SAME family, billed) is used only on the user's own tick (`fallback_env`).
A new provider is one adapter file plus one `Engine` row here; engine.py and every AI module stay as they are. Guarded by
tests/test_ai_providers.py (every engine meets the contract) and tests/test_ai_engine.py.
