"""📥 Log anything: a pasted message or a screenshot (LinkedIn, Gmail, WhatsApp…) -> the right job, updated or created.

Claude Haiku 5.5 reads the text or the image once, together with the list of jobs Notion already knows (tracked
applications first, then open Job Matches), and says what it is and which job it's about:

- **a job already tracked** in Applications -> its event (reply, interview time, rejection, offer…) and Stage moved
  forward (never back, like the Gmail check); a recruiter writing about a saved job makes it a Recruiter lead.
- **an open job** in Job Matches, not tracked yet -> an Applications row for that job (its own URL), then the event.
- **nothing known** -> a new row: a recruiter's pitch becomes a Recruiter lead (src/ai/opportunity.py); an
  application, reply, interview or outcome for another role is tracked as applied elsewhere, then the event.

The message and the screenshot are kept on the job's page. The same paste twice changes nothing (Source ID).

Usage:
  python -m src.ai.inbox --text-file message.txt [--image shot.png] [--talking]
