"""The models of the AI steps, as data: three tiers (small, main, big) per family (Claude, OpenAI).

Modules name a tier's model (SMALL_MODEL, MAIN_MODEL, BIG_MODEL: Claude's ids, the contract's reference); an engine of another family maps
it to the same tier there (`for_family`), so no module knows which provider answers. Each tier can be changed without a release: the app
sets JOB_PILOTTO_SMALL_MODEL (Claude) and JOB_PILOTTO_OPENAI_<TIER>_MODEL on this Mac and as variables in the user's Always on repo
(desktop/lib/github.js); an Always on repo runs the engine of the app's own release, which never changes (8 Oct 2026: Haiku 4.5 -> 5.5).
The literals below are only the fallbacks when nothing set them. OpenAI tiers approved by the owner (9 Oct 2026), priced like Claude's:
small gpt-6-luna (= Haiku 5.5), main gpt-6.1-sol (= Sonnet 5.5), big gpt-6.1-sol at high effort (gpt-6-astra costs 2.5x Opus).
