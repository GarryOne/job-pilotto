"""Which inputs produced a kit, so the app can say whether it's still current.

A kit is drafted from the CV, the scoring part of the Profile (score.scoring_profile: contact and links left out)
and the standard answers. Their fingerprints go on the job's Applications row ("Kit inputs", e.g.
"cv:3f2a91c0d4e1 profile:9b0e… answers:77c1…"); the Jobs list compares them with today's inputs:
current (all the same), earlier (one changed since: "Drafted with earlier inputs"), unknown (a kit from before this
was recorded). Nothing is redrafted by itself.
