"""Interview analysis: a recording, a transcript file or typed notes -> 🎤 Interviews.

The Worker passes the Telegram file id (or the notes text) to a `--mode interview` run; the desktop app
passes a file on the Mac, and optionally the job it belongs to (--job <job URL>). A recording (voice note,
audio or video) is first transcribed on the machine, with speakers, by transcribe.py (open-source models,
free). This module strips subtitle timing (.srt/.vtt), and asks Claude Sonnet 5 in one call to
(1) pick which application the interview belongs to (unless the job was given), from the caption and the transcript, and
(2) pull out the questions by topic, how each was answered, strengths, weak spots, signals from the
interviewers, the next step and what to practise.

The same call (3) pulls out the facts the call revealed about the job (salary, contract, relocation, place,
team, visa, start date), each only when said and with a short quote.

The result is a 🎤 Interviews row linked to the application (analysis plus the full transcript in its
page body) and the application moved on (advance(): the call happened, so a Recruiter lead, Screening or
Interview scheduled is Interviewing now; never back, never a closed stage), with its 📈 Application Events row,
Next step from the review, a past Next interview cleared and the call's facts filled into empty fields (a
different value already there is not overwritten: the review page and the summary show both). Then a Telegram
summary. The daily insight and weekly report read the Interviews rows.
A row reviewed before can be reviewed again from the app (review_again(): the review replaced, only empty fields
of the job filled, no Stage change or event). A recording saved without a review moves the application on the same way (save(), link()); an interview
that wasn't recorded is confirmed from Focus ("Did it happen?": held(), moved(), cancelled()).
Each user's Notion is their own private database; the transcript stays there and in Telegram.
