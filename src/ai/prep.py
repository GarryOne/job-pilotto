"""Interview prep kit: how to prepare for one interview, from the job's description, your Profile and how your past
interviews went. Written on the job's Notion page (🎤 Interview prep) and dated in the Interview prep column.

It needs to know the role first: the job's description (🧾 Job description, from a pasted message or screenshots, or
added here), a posting it can read, or a recruiter's message that describes the role. Without one it asks for it
(needs_description) instead of guessing.

    python -m src.ai.prep build <application page id>
    python -m src.ai.prep describe <application page id> [--text TEXT] [--url URL]
Prints one JSON line: {"ok": ..., "text": ..., "needs_description": ...}.

intro kit (the pitch, generic motivation questions they already heard). Fill since_last_call with what the last call
established and what they said would be discussed next; questions are the likely ones for THIS round (e.g. salary,
contract setup, relocation, start date for a recruiter follow-up; deeper stack and incidents for a technical round);
