"""Notion "⏰ Cronjob Runs": one row per scheduled pipeline run, with its cost and a mini-report.

`daily.main()` fills a run dict as it goes (crawl counts, per-stage AI stats from enrich/score/kit,
Job Matches sync, Telegram outcome, warnings) and hands it to `log_run` at the end. The report is
written by code from those numbers, so it costs nothing; a Notion failure never fails the run.
