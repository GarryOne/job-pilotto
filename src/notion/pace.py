"""One Notion pace shared with the desktop app and every other process on this computer using the same connection.

Notion allows about 3 requests a second per connection, counted together: the app, this engine and a terminal run
each pacing only themselves still burst past it (429). They take turns through one small file in the temp folder,
named after a hash of the token. Same file and format as desktop/lib/notion-pace.js: "<next slot ms> <calm until ms>".
A mkdir lock makes each claim atomic (across processes and threads). If the file can't be used, the process keeps
its own pace.
