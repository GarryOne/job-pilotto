"""Outbound or inbound: did you go after this opportunity, or did it find you? The Applications row's own Origin column
(select Inbound / Outbound) says it: a fact set once when the row is created (stamp(), by every path that creates a
row), which you can change by hand in Notion, or answer in the app's Log job activity ("Who reached out first?", when the
conversation began before the job's first contact: src/ai/inbox.py) (e.g. a job you had saved before a recruiter wrote about it). The same
reading here and in the desktop app (desktop/renderer/origin.js); both are checked against one table,
tests/fixtures/opportunity_origin.json, so they cannot drift.

Origin set: it wins. Origin empty (rows from before the column): derived from the row, the rule below, which is also
what the one-time backfill writes (python -m src.notion.origin --backfill [--apply]; the app runs it at start-up).

- Inbound: a recruiter's pitch (Stage "Recruiter lead", a "Recruiter lead" event, Notes "Recruiter message (…)":
  src/ai/opportunity.py, however it was logged: Gmail, Telegram, the app), or a job whose first contact was a
  LinkedIn message or a phone call (Source LinkedIn / Phone: src/ai/opportunity.py source_for).
- Outbound: everything else: found by a search, saved, applied from the app, "Applied elsewhere" (Notes
  "Logged from a paste (…)", even from a LinkedIn paste), a confirmation email (Source Gmail). Unknown or empty
  Source counts as outbound.
- The first contact decides: a recruiter writing about a job you had only saved is inbound; one reacting to your
  application (an "Applied" or "Confirmation received" event before the "Recruiter lead" one) keeps it outbound.

Usage:
  python -m src.notion.origin --backfill           # list the rows whose Origin is empty, and what they would get
  python -m src.notion.origin --backfill --apply   # write it (rows with an Origin are never touched)
