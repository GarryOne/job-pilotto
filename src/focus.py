"""Focus: what to do next in the job search, most important first. No AI, so it costs nothing.

Read from the active store (src/stores: applications, events, interviews, insights; Notion or this Mac), in this order:
1. 💬 Reply: a person wrote (a reply, a recruiter's pitch, an offer) and nothing was done since.
   📅 Book the call: the reply invites you to pick a slot.
2. 🎤 Prepare: an interview is coming (within 48 h first); ❓ did it happen? once its time passed and nothing was
   recorded (yes: notes and a review; no: moved or cancelled), or 📝 review one that was recorded.
   📨 Follow up: you wrote last (a "Replied" event: your logged chat, your sent Gmail, Done here) and nothing came
   back for FOLLOW_UP_HOURS; no interview ahead. It replaces "Move it forward" for that job.
   🤝 Move it forward: a Screening with nothing booked and no news for 3 days. ⏳ Waiting for their next step
   after an interview you reviewed, until 3 days without news.
3. 📨 Apply: today's applications against the daily target, with the jobs whose kit is ready.
4. 🔎 Learn: the latest rejection lesson; ⏳ applications waiting 7+ days without a human reply.

"Done" on a reply item logs a "Replied" event (the store keeps it; the item then goes away). The Desktop App shows
the list (Focus) and, at 11:00, 15:00 and 19:00, reminds you (notification, and Telegram with --send) when
you're behind the daily target or someone waits for an answer.

Usage:
  python -m src.focus [--target 30]            # the list as JSON (for the app); the target defaults to
                                               # "Daily applications target" on ⚙️ Search settings
  python -m src.focus done <page id> replied   # you answered: log it
  python -m src.focus done <page id> details_skipped  # you don't know the employer yet: it stays skipped
  python -m src.focus history                   # what you resolved from Focus, newest first
  python -m src.focus remind [--target 30] [--send]
