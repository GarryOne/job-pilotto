"""The jobs check's search itself (modes scheduled, run, today, more): crawl the feeds, import, enrich, score, sync Job Matches and the
ledger, build the digest, send it to Telegram, save and log the run. `search(args, stores)` returns the exit code. The data is the
active store's (src/stores: open once, passed down), on every store; this Mac's store never gets a copy in Notion.
Tests: tests/test_daily.py, tests/test_refresh_batch.py, tests/test_search_budget.py, tests/test_places_strict.py, tests/test_place_triage.py,
tests/test_contribute.py, tests/test_watch.py, tests/test_score.py.
